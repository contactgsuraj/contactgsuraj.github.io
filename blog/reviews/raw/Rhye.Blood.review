Blood
Rhye
2018-02-06
The duo consisting Mike Milosh and Robin Braun, better known as Rhye, would in 2013 release <i>Woman</i>. <i>Woman</i> aggressively dealt with the softer parts of life and love. Bold in its message, but delivered with fragile gentleness, almost soft to the touch, <i>Woman</i> did little to avoid the comparisons to Sade. Milosh's ethereal androgynous vocal melodies filled in by lush production on pieces like "Open" and "The Fall" would proceed to create Internet frenzy and garner critical acclaim amongst most publications.<br><br> Early in 2017, Braun would proceed to leave the band as Rhye turned into a solo project with Milosh and a band, centred around its live performances. <i style="color: red;">Blood</i> as such, under the command of Milosh, continues what was started with <i>Woman</i>. The band here, is a direct step up from the studio experiment that <i>Woman</i> was. Each note and measure is calculated, crisp and precise. Played in a mellow and deliberate manner, every pulse of music here, oozes with sexiness and calms the nerves, with a unforetold sophistication. The atmosphere that is intricately sculpted, song by song, is admirable. Rather unfortunate that the album is all style, and no substance.<br><br> The Nicolas Winding Refn of albums, <i>Blood</i> has all the production and instrumental flourishes, but nothing more concrete to back it up, emasculated and stripped of an identity. Agreeable at best, the worst parts of soft pop music come to light over the course of 42 minutes. Music you could nod your head to, but nothing more. The lack of any emotive and powerful songs like "Open" from Rhye's debut also makes for a consistently plain, and unoffensive album. The only exception to this rule is track nine, "Phoenix". Embracing a groove, Rhye work out of their comfort zone, creatively reworking funk motifs. Milosh chants, "oh my god", as the bass-line takes a life of its own.<br><br> Though the album never reaches the peaks the band's debut did, it offers a couple of decent songs sprinkled about to make the listening experience marginally pleasant. Almost ironically, <i>Blood</i> seems to be trying its best to emulate <i>Woman</i>, whereas it undeniably has the potential to forgo the clich√©s of its soft rock roots and be something more wild and free. Something with a mind of its own. With some sort of personality. Come on Mike.<br><br>
