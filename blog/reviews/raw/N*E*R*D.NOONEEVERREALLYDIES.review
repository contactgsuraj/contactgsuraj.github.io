NO ONE EVER REALLY DIES
N*E*R*D
2018-01-08
After the seminal "*In Search Of...*", N*E*R*D's offerings throughout the noughties were but a string of disappointing releases. As the collective fell off everyone's radar, its most prominent member, Pharrell Williams, began his meteoric rise to stardom. Chad Hugo and Williams would continue to produce together as "The Neptunes".  Williams' work became ubiquitous with hit single after hit single, year after year . While Williams' wasn't working on frivolous commercial albums like "Girl" and on the soundtrack of films like "Despicable Me", "Despicable Me 2" and the nerve-wracking conclusion "Despicable Me 3", his more discrete production work absolutely took off. As Williams' and The Neptunes' resume of production credits grew, they presented some of the most off-kilter, original and creative production the hip-hop scene had ever encountered. They had transfor what would otherwise be bland pop songs, dynamic and filled with life. The duo had carved themselves a place in hip-hop's history after producing Clipse's monstrous "Hell Hath No Fury", an absolutely electric piece of work.<br><br> Cut to 2017 and Williams is now a household name. The first single "Lemon" is released out of the left-field with only some cryptic marketing prior. And not too long after, this album is announced. <br><br> NO ONE EVER REALLY DIES is iconic and striking from the get go. The album art is bizarre and strange, vulgar and yet memorable, with a woman donning a foil grill, shot in a style vaguely reminiscent of Terry Richardson. The production on this album is alive, booming and undeniably fierce. Exploring new ground effortlessly song by song. The album blends the hardest, most experimental shades of hip-hop with the ethos of pop music almost seamlessly. Energetic performances from a wide selection of guest vocalists ranging from Gucci Mane to Ed Sheeran (who is surprisingly decent on this) to Kendrick with the highly varied production and beat switches makes for an engaging and addictive listen. The album starts off strong, with hard hitters like "Lemon" and "Voila" leading the way, the latter featuring an insanely catchy hook with Gucci Mane. For the fifth track, we are gifted with "Don't Do It!", featuring Kendrick, arguably the best song on this album. Pulsating with its short guitar stabs, the track explores some dense lyrical ground regarding police brutality and racial unrest, as does a lot of this album.<br><br> Tracks 6 to 8 are a short lull in this album. While exploring new sounds and ideas, they fail to pay off in any way in this stretch. "ESP" is generally dull, structured quite poorly and the production isn't going to save the entire 5 minutes. Same goes for "Lightning Fire Magic Prayer", and "Rollinem 7's". The only thing here that is worth salvaging is Andre 3K's fiery but short verse.<br><br> Things pick up again afterwards, with "Kites" featuring M.I.A and Kendrick, with some of the most hypnotic production on this album. M.I.A's woozy delivery and Kendrick's razor sharp delivery together are a little jarring but are certainly a refreshing change from the stagnant tracks prior. However, "Secret Life of Tigers" is Williams at his most woke, where the lyrics turned from an accessory of the production to obnoxious and silly, making it hard to take the song seriously. This is all rather unfortunate as the song could have evidently been so much more. The album finishes with "Lifting You" featuring Ed Sheeran, where he isn't absolutely dreadful. Things end on a relaxed and rather limp note, with easy going production that sticks out in the album, and not in a good way. The more aggressive and edgy production is really what made many of the earlier songs on here enjoyable.<br><br> Through several listens, it has become evident that we do indeed have a good album over here. But, its inconsistencies are really the only thing stopping this album from being truly great. While most ideas here are original and new, some are plagues by structural and lyrical issues. Lyrically, Williams leaves a lot to be desired given the difficult topics he tries to cover. Despite all this, the album is mostly enjoyable but given some more, I reckon this album is one that will make its mark in the future as "quintessential N*E*R*D"
