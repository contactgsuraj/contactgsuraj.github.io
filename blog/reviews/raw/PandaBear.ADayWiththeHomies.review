A Day With the Homies
Panda Bear
2018-01-17
Panda Bear, born Noah Lennox, has become a prevalent figure withing the indie music community. A purveyor of genres, Lennox and his artistic counterpart Avey Tare (Michael Portner) have created some of the wildest and most original compositions from the mysterious space they seem to occupy in the music world. Animal Collective's work, before and including "Merriweather Post Pavillion" have been heralded as masterful works of experimental pop and folk music. Somewhere somehow, Lennox's solo work started to overshadow Animal Collective's output. Well, not <i>somehow</i>. "Person Pitch" was released in 2007. The single greatest Animal Collective record was a hazy, anti-social and weird Panda Bear solo LP. "Person Pitch", undeniably Lennox's magnum opus, would become the defining psych-pop record of the 21st Century, like a "Loveless" of shoegaze or an "Illmatic".<br><br> Lennox would continue to put out two good, verging on great, albums after "Person Pitch". Out of absolutely no where, Lennox drops "A Day With The Homies", a 29 minute EP just a couple of days ago as I am writing this. Upping his social media activity out of the blue, Lennox is essentially drafting up buzz, for what might be his 5th solo LP.<br><br> "Homies" is possibly a bunch of outtakes from the forthcoming LP, or not. Regardless, the tracks do well enough on their own. Generally disconnected thematically, sonically everything blends into one, as is trademark of an Animal Collective member. Every track here sways back and forth, warped and wrapped in nature recordings and bizzare sonic textures. Lennox's best Brian Wilson impression comes through again, like ever, transforming the obfuscated hazy production into something ethereal. Choir boy vocals ran through an SP-404 delay makes for a dreamy soundscape, in which one could get lost easily.<br><br> In my personal copy of "Person Pitch", the inner booklet lists a bunch of artists directly influencing Lennox's work. It is perhaps strange that Lennox, who dabbles in forms of psychedelic music, would be so heavily influenced by techno musicians such as Wolfgang Voigt and Deep House architect Luomo amongst many other. Then again perhaps it isn't. The majority of Lennox's work has had a prevalent "driving force" behind them , highly reminiscent of common techno beat patterns.<br><br> "Homies" is however, very outright with this, with a bouncy kick drum and a buzzy bass from the opener 'Flight', continuing the Mr. Sonic Boom's sounds off of Lennox's previous solo effort "Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper". With all the highs of this album, sonics can only do so much. Structurally it is inherently deficient, in the sense that is only an EP. That said, Animal collective have had standup EP's such as "Fall Be Kind". Lennox's current schtick, the "busy for the sake of being busy" sound, is occasianally annoying here. Still this manages to be a more memorable experience than one of the last two Animal Collective albums.<br><br> On "Homies", Lennox essentially gives us a taste of the upcoming album, yet, it stands rather well on its own. Whatever Noah has been brewing over the last couple of years, I want it.
Animal Collective, The Flaming Lips, Deerhunter
