Love Is a Stream
Jefre Cantu-Ledesma
2017-11-13
Like a warm hug, from someone you've never seen. Cantu-Ledesma channels everything raw and pure into 44 minutes of bliss. As the title suggests, the album is a continuous stream of tracks and passages all evocative of some unknown and warmer time. Everything from the cover art to the production feels warm. A warm embrace. Love Is a Stream is the most texturally beautiful thing my ears have had the pleasure of hearing in a long while, very much resembling Fennesz's efforts in endless summer. It is unfortunate that in the context of the album, some songs are rather lacklustre and somewhat repetitive. Unlike some of the veterans of the ambient and drone scene, Cantu-Ledesma is unable to make an album, or an experience. Luckily, a handful of dense and mesmerizing pieces help string something together. Something inexplicably warm. A warm embrace.
