Dissed and Dismissed
Tony Molina
2019-02-17
For something that runs under 12 minutes, it quite literally pushes the definitions of an album. Regardless, on <i>Dissed</i>, Molina does his best to pack every single song here with the most infectious, energetic and raw music. Much like MGMT's "Someone's Missing", every piece on here builds itself up only to end prematurely, leaving me desperately wanting for more. <br><br> It'd be ironic to lengthily explicate why this album is so darn good. Essentially, the lyricism is heart breaking, the grooves are crunchy, and, this ultimate begs the question: How do I stop myself from listening to this album another time? Well, I don't think I will.
Early Emo, Weezer maybe? I have no idea
Nowhere to Go, Change My Ways, Nothing I Can Do, Spoke To Soon
4/5
